Final Project

Title: "Predicting Cancer Type and Identifying Key Features in Brain MRI Using Machine Learning"

Goals:

1. To train a model for accurately predicting cancer type and identifying important features in brain MRI data.
2. To assist in early detection and prognosis of brain cancer, aiding personalized medicine.

Results:

The AdaBoost classifier showed the best metrics in cancer type detection. However, all models exhibited limitations, possibly due to data resampling and imbalance, indicating a need for improved feature selection and sampling techniques.
